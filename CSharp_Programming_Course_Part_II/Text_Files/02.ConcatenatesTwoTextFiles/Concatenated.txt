The Avengers is a team of superheroes, appearing in comic books published by Marvel Comics.
The team made its debut in The Avengers #1 (Sept. 1963), created by writer-editor Stan Lee and artist/co-plotter Jack Kirby,
following the trend of super-hero teams after the success of DC Comics' Justice League of America.
Labeled Earth's Mightiest Heroes, the Avengers originally consisted of Iron Man, Ant-Man, the Wasp, Thor, and the Hulk.
The original Captain America was discovered, trapped in ice (issue #4), and joined the group after they revived him. 
A rotating roster became a hallmark, although one theme remained consistent:
the Avengers fight "the foes no single superhero can withstand."
The team, famous for its battle cry of "Avengers Assemble!",
has featured humans, mutants, robots, aliens, supernatural beings, and even former villains.
