        <p>The Flash is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics.
           Created by writer Gardner Fox and artist Harry Lampert, the original Flash first appeared in Flash Comics #1 (January 1940).
           Nicknamed the "Scarlet Speedster", the "Crimson Comet", "The Blur", "The Streak", and "James Whiting" all incarnations
           of the Flash possess "super speed", which includes the ability to run and move extremely fast, use superhuman reflexes,
           and seemingly violate certain laws of physics.<br />
           Young Barry Allen’s life stopped the minute his mother was murdered.
           The true killer never found, its mystery obsessed Barry, driving him to become a forensic scientist.
           Consumed by his work, he spent his life chained to his desk, solving every case that flew across it.
           But when a freak lightning bolt hits a nearby shelf in his lab, Barry receives super-speed, becoming the Flash.
           Now, he’ll race up buildings, across oceans, and around the world to get his man—while getting introduced to
           a world so much bigger than his old life of microscopes and cold cases.
